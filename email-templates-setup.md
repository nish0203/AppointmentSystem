## Implementation Steps

### 1. EmailJS Dashboard Setup
1. Go to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/)
2. Create a new service or use your existing Mailgun service
3. Create each template above with the exact template IDs:
   - `template_appointment_reminder`
   - `template_booking_confirmation`
   - `template_booking_approved`
   - `template_booking_cancelled`
   - `template_reschedule_request`
   - `template_reschedule_approved`
   - `template_reschedule_rejected`
   - `template_slot_booked_alert`

### 2. Template Variables
Each template uses specific variables that are passed from the JavaScript code. Make sure to include all the variables shown in the templates above.

### 3. HTML File Integration
Add this to any HTML file where you want to use email notifications:

```html
<!-- EmailJS SDK -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@4/dist/email.min.js"></script>
<!-- Email Service -->
<script src="email-service.js"></script>
```

### 4. Usage Examples

#### Send Booking Confirmation
```javascript
await EmailService.sendBookingConfirmation({
  studentEmail: 'student@example.com',
  studentName: 'John Doe',
  lecturerName: 'Dr. Smith',
  lecturerEmail: 'dr.smith@university.edu',
  date: '2024-01-15',
  time: '10:00 AM',
  purpose: 'Project discussion',
  bookingId: 'BK001'
});
```

#### Send Slot Booked Alert
```javascript
await EmailService.sendSlotBookedAlert({
  lecturerEmail: 'dr.smith@university.edu',
  lecturerName: 'Dr. Smith',
  studentName: 'John Doe',
  studentEmail: 'student@example.com',
  studentId: 'ST001',
  date: '2024-01-15',
  time: '10:00 AM',
  purpose: 'Project discussion',
  bookingId: 'BK001'
});
```

#### Schedule Automatic Reminders
```javascript
await EmailService.scheduleReminders({
  recipientEmail: 'student@example.com',
  recipientName: 'John Doe',
  date: '2024-01-15',
  time: '10:00 AM',
  purpose: 'Project discussion',
  otherPartyName: 'Dr. Smith',
  otherPartyEmail: 'dr.smith@university.edu',
  appointmentId: 'APT001'
});
```

## Rate Limiting & Best Practices

1. **Batch Processing**: Use `sendBatchNotifications()` for multiple emails
2. **Rate Limiting**: The service includes 1-second delays between emails
3. **Error Handling**: All methods return `{success: boolean, error?: any}`
4. **Logging**: Console logs show success/failure for debugging

## Testing

Test each template by calling the methods with sample data:

```javascript
// Test booking confirmation
EmailService.sendBookingConfirmation({
  studentEmail: 'test@example.com',
  studentName: 'Test Student',
  lecturerName: 'Test Lecturer',
  lecturerEmail: 'lecturer@test.com',
  date: '2024-01-15',
  time: '10:00 AM',
  purpose: 'Test appointment',
  bookingId: 'TEST001'
});
```
